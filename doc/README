WHAT IS LADVD?
--------------

ladvd is a cdp / lldp sender for unix.

ladvd uses cdp / lldp frames to inform switches about connected hosts,
which simplifies ethernet switch management. It does this by creating
the required payloads and descriptors on startup and then switching 
to a non-privileged user for the remaining runtime.


USAGE
-----

Basically you start ladvd like any unix daemon. 
To get a complete list of supported options type

  ladvd -h

and see the manual for more information.


SETUP
-----

Ladvd needs root privileges to initialize the required raw-sockets.
It can run in `daemon' mode, logging to syslog, or in the foreground,
logging to stderr.

To install ladvd, first run the "configure" script. This will create a
Makefile and config.h appropriate for your system. Then type
"make". 

Once built put a copy of ladvd in your search path on the local and
remote systems (or use "make install"). That's it!
