.SH NAME
ladvd \- send link layer advertisements
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "ladvd [ -a ]" 
.BI "[ " INTERFACE " ] [ " INTERFACE " ]"
.B ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ladvd
sends LLDP link layer advertisements on all available interfaces. This makes connected hosts visible on managed switches. By default it will run as a privilege-separated daemon. Additional protocols can be enabled using the -C, -E, -F and -N options. Optionally a list of interfaces which
.B ladvd
should utilize can be supplied.
.SH INTERFACES
.B ladvd
detects and uses all configured (UP) physical Ethernet interfaces by default, wireless interfaces can be enabled via the -w option. Additionally
.B ladvd
will recognize bundled interfaces (bridges, bonding) and use these to transmit additional information. The result is that normally it should not be necessary to specify interfaces on the
.B ladvd
command-line. The only reason for specifying interfaces is to explicitly exclude a particular interface.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -a
Auto-enable protocols based on received packets.
.IP -d
Dump pcap-compatible packets to stdout which can be piped to tcpdump (via "| tcpdump -r -") or redirected to a file for further analysis.
.IP -f
Run in the foreground and send logging to stderr.
.IP -h
Print usage instructions.
.IP "-m address"
Management address for unnumbered interfaces, can be specified for IPv4 and IPv6.
.IP -n
Use management addresses specified via -m for all interfaces.
.IP -o
Run only once, useful for quick troubleshooting.
.IP -r
Receive packets, and use them for various features.
.IP "-u user"
Switch to this user (defaults to PACKAGE_USER)
.IP -v
Increase logging verbosity.
.IP -w
Use wireless interfaces.
.IP -z
Save received peer information in interface descriptions (requires SIOCSIFDESCR support)
.IP "-c <CC>"
Specify a two-letter ISO 3166 country code (required for LLDP location support).
.IP "-l <location>"
Specify the physical location of the host.
.IP -C
Enable CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol).
.IP -E
Enable EDP (Extreme Discovery Protocol).
.IP -F
Enable FDP (Foundry Discovery Protocol).
.IP -N
Enable NDP (Nortel Discovery Protocol) formerly called SynOptics Network Management Protocol (SONMP).
