This is a short list of things to test before a release:

- Test linux builds via OBS
- Test FreeBSD / OpenBSD builds
- Check code-coverage via lcov
- Compile with clang
- Look for errors with Clang Static Analyzer
- Do a couple of runs with valgrind
- Run checksec - http://www.trapkit.de/tools/checksec.html
- Do some real-world tests with switches
- ???
